# Assembly instructions
## Wiring
The wiring is the weak part here and I don't provide instructions on it. Please figure it out yourself, there are not many wires in there
## Step 0
Disassemble existing toolheads. That should be easy, just unscrew and unplug everything. You don't need to disassemble heatsink of second toolhead, just unscrew it.
## Step 1

Assemble hotend. Temporarily secure it in place and do cable managment. For CHC you need to cut wires to length and crimp them with proper connectors. You also need to bend metal piece or unscrew it. Make sure wires fit inside chasing.

## Step 2

Move hotend to place and secure it with M3x22 screws. For right toolhead you may want to use M3x24 screw and nuts are nessecary sicne holes aren't threaded.

## Step 4
