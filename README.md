# Why?
Do you want to have two printers in one? Print with two completely different filaments? You don't like bedsilngers and prefer a faster and more compact printer? And not overpaying for a SnapMaker J1S or Ratrig V-Core? Then this upgrade kit is for you! Climber-8A is a very interesting 3D printer from aliexpress, the cheapest IDEX I could find that isn't a bedsilnger. Mechanically and electronically it is quite good, especially for its price, but has a number of flaws very undesirable in 2024, such as for example the bowden feed mechanism, low print speed, no input shaping and so on. This project is designed to fix them!
